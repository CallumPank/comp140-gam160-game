I intend my game to be a variation of ‘Pong’. The objective of the game is to bounce an object between two paddles. When one player misses and the object falls past them, the other player will score points.

Game Play 
The player is represented by a “Pong Paddle”. The player controls the paddle at the moment by using the arrow keys or w/s keys. The player can activate many power ups in the game (listed below). The object that the players must hit between the paddles changes depending on the game mode. Circle being the regular game mode. Triangle is an extra game mode.

What Are Alternative Controllers?
Traditional controllers are built by video game developers such as Microsoft (Xbox controller) and Nintendo (Wii Remote) these are the controllers that are usually associated when you think of controllers or video games. 
Alternative controllers are the controllers that are custom made for example custard bowls. 
Hijacked traditional controllers such as a keyboard that has been modified.
Arcade Cabinets such as those designed to play Tekken or Street Fighter but with an innovative design such as a webcam or a microphone.
Installations these are controllers can be traditional but are different because to be used they need a certain setting such as a room or cubicles.
Playful Performances these are just live performances that are controlled by the crowd such as Take Control which gives two members of the crowd control over two actors with the controllers being laser pointers.
Playable at Home these are games that can be played with traditional controllers but are used in a unique way such as Space Team which uses the microphone in an IPad. 
Alternative Controllers:
Dildo Controller – Genital Jousting. This game uses 8 joysticks with ball tops and 8 dildos of varying colour and size to control virtual penises on screen.
Webcam- No Pain No Gain. This game uses a webcam, players jump into a white sheet and depending on how close they are to the projection on the wall they will gain points.

Controller Description
A large see through box with two 8 direction joysticks on either end of the box. 4 arcade buttons placed near each joystick. 

The Joysticks would be used to operate the players pong paddles, the 4 buttons would be used to send out power ups.

Using feedback from tutors I have decided to move away from using a joystick and potentially the buttons as well. Instead of a joystick I would like to use a linear potentiometer to control the paddles. 

Also I would like to use a light sensor or something along those lines.
