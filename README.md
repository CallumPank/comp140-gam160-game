I intend my game to be a variation of ‘Pong’. The objective of the game is to bounce an object between two paddles. When one player misses and the object falls past them, the other player will score points.

Game Play 
The player is represented by a “Pong Paddle”. The player controls the paddle at the moment by using the arrow keys or w/s keys. The player can activate many power ups in the game (listed below).
